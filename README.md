This repository contains the official implementation of the NeurIPS 2023 paper [*Predict, Refine, Synthesize: Self-Guiding Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11494). In this paper, we propose *TSDiff*, an unconditional diffusion model for time series. Our proposed self-guidance mechanism enables conditioning TSDiff for downstream tasks during inference, without requiring auxiliary networks or altering the training procedure. Furthermore, our refinement scheme leverages the implicit density learned by the diffusion model to iteratively refine the predictions of base forecasters. Finally, we demonstrate the high quality of the synthetic time series by training downstrain models solely on generated data and introducing the *Linear Predictive Score (LPS)*.

## Installation

TSDiff requires Python 3.8 or higher.

* Create a conda environment (optional, but recommended).
```sh
conda create --name tsdiff --yes python=3.8 && conda activate tsdiff
```
* Install this package.
```sh
pip install --editable "."
```

### What's different in this branch?

This branch has some updates that should make training faster. This would make it easier to test TSDiff out or use it on some custom dataset. If you're interested in reproducing the results from the paper, please use the main branch. Here are the key differences in this branch.
- Callback that evaluates during training has been removed.
- Instead, the denoising loss on the validation is used for checkpoint selection.
- Train only for 100 epochs.
- Shuffle buffer is used during training.

## Usage

### Training Models

Train models using the `train_model.py` and `train_cond_model.py` scripts for `TSDiff` and `TSDiff-Cond`, respectively. Sample configurations can be found in `configs/train_tsdiff.yaml` and `configs/train_tsdiff-cond.yaml`. Specific configurations used in the paper can be found in `configs/train_tsdiff` and `configs/train_tsdiff-cond`.

Example commands for regular (i.e., no missing values) forecasting:
```sh
# Train TSDiff on the Uber dataset for regular forecasting
python bin/train_model.py -c configs/train_tsdiff/train_uber_tlc.yaml

# Train TSDiff on the M4 dataset for regular forecasting
python bin/train_model.py -c configs/train_tsdiff/train_m4.yaml

# Train TSDiff-Cond on the Uber dataset for regular forecasting
python bin/train_cond_model.py -c configs/train_tsdiff-cond/uber_tlc_hourly.yaml

# Train TSDiff-Cond on the M4 dataset for regular forecasting
python bin/train_cond_model.py -c configs/train_tsdiff-cond/m4_hourly.yaml
```

Example commands for forecasting with missing values:
```sh
# Train TSDiff on the Uber dataset for the missing values experiment
python bin/train_model.py -c configs/train_tsdiff/train_missing_uber_tlc.yaml

# Train TSDiff on the KDDCup dataset for the missing values experiment
python bin/train_model.py -c configs/train_tsdiff/train_missing_kdd_cup.yaml

# Train TSDiff-Cond on the Uber dataset for the RM missing values experiment
python bin/train_cond_model.py -c configs/train_tsdiff-cond/missing_RM_uber_tlc_hourly.yaml

# Train TSDiff-Cond on the KDDCup dataset for the BM-B missing values experiment
python bin/train_cond_model.py -c configs/train_tsdiff-cond/missing_BM-B_kdd_cup_2018_without_missing.yaml

# Train TSDiff-Cond on the KDDCup dataset for the BM-E missing values experiment
python bin/train_cond_model.py -c configs/train_tsdiff-cond/missing_BM-E_kdd_cup_2018_without_missing.yaml
```
Note that for TSDiff we train only one model and all the missing value scenarios are evaluated using the same unconditional model. However, for TSDiff-Cond, one model is trained per missingness scenario.

### Evaluating Models
The unconditional models trained above can be used for the following tasks.

#### Predict using Observation Self-Guidance
Use the `guidance_experiment.py` script and `configs/guidance.yaml` config to run the forecasting experiments. Specific configurations used in the paper can be found in `configs/guidance/`.

Example commands:
```sh
# Run observation self-guidance on the Solar dataset
python bin/guidance_experiment.py -c configs/guidance/guidance_solar.yaml --ckpt /path/to/ckpt

# Run observation self-guidance on the KDDCup dataset
python bin/guidance_experiment.py -c configs/guidance/guidance_kdd_cup.yaml --ckpt /path/to/ckpt
```

#### Refine Predictions of Base Forecasters
Use `refinement_experiment.py` script and `configs/refinement.yaml` config to run the refinement experiments. Specific configurations used in the paper can be found in `configs/refinement/`.

Example commands:
```sh
# Refine predictions from the Linear model on the Solar dataset
python bin/refinement_experiment.py -c configs/refinement/solar_nips-linear.yaml --ckpt /path/to/ckpt

# Refine predictions from the DeepAR model on the M4 dataset
python bin/refinement_experiment.py -c configs/refinement/m4_hourly-deepar.yaml --ckpt /path/to/ckpt
```
#### Train Downstream Models using Synthetic Data
Use `tstr_experiment.py` script and `configs/tstr.yaml` config to run the _train on synthetic-test on real_ experiments. Specific configurations used in the paper can be found in `configs/tstr/`.

Example commands:
```sh
# TSTR on the Solar Dataset
python bin/tstr_experiment.py -c configs/tstr/solar_nips.yaml --ckpt /path/to/ckpt

# TSTR on the KDDCup Dataset
python bin/tstr_experiment.py -c configs/tstr/kdd_cup_2018_without_missing.yaml --ckpt /path/to/ckpt
```
